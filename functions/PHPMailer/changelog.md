## Version 6.0.1 (September 14th 2017)
* Use shorter Message-ID headers (with more entropy) to avoid iCloud blackhole bug
* Switch to Symfony code style (though it's not well defined)
* CI builds now apply syntax & code style checks, so make your PRs tidy!
* CI code coverage only applied on latest version of PHP to speed up builds (thanks to @Slamdunk for these CI changes)

* Rename test scripts to PSR-4 spec
* Make content-id values settable on attachments, not just embedded items
* Add SMTP transaction IDs to callbacks & allow for future expansion
* Expand test coverage

## Version 6.0 (August 28th 2017)
This is a major update that breaks backwards compatibility.

* **Requires PHP 5.5 or later**
* **Uses the `PHPMailer\PHPMailer` namespace**
* File structure simplified and PSR-4 compatible, classes live in the `src/` folder
* The custom autoloader has been removed: [**use composer**](https://getcomposer.org)!
* Classes & Exceptions renamed to make use of the namespace
* Most statically called functions now use the `static` keyword instead of `self`, so it's possible to override static internal functions in subclasses, for example `validateAddress()`
* Complete RFC standardisation on CRLF (`\r\n`) line breaks for SMTP by default:
  * `PHPMailer:$LE` defaults to CRLF
  * All uses of `PHPMailer::$LE` property converted to use `static::$LE` constant for consistency and ease of overriding
  * Similar changes to line break handling in SMTP and POP3 classes.
  * Line break format for `mail()` transport is set automatically.
  * Warnings emitted for buggy `mail()` in PHP versions 7.0.0 - 7.0.16 and 7.1.0 - 7.1.2; either upgrade or switch to SMTP.
* Extensive reworking of XOAUTH2, adding support for Google, Yahoo and Microsoft providers, thanks to @sherryl4george
* Major cleanup of docs and examples
* All elements previously marked as deprecated have been removed:
  * `PHPMailer->Version` (replaced with `VERSION` constant)
  * `PHPMailer->ReturnPath`
  * `PHPMailer->PluginDir`
  * `PHPMailer->encodeQPphp()`
  * `SMTP->CRLF` (replaced with `LE` constant)
  * `SMTP->Version` (replaced with `VERSION` constant)
  * `SMTP->SMTP_PORT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_PORT` constant)
  * `POP3->CRLF` (replaced with `LE` constant)
  * `POP3->Version` (replaced with `VERSION` constant)
  * `POP3->POP3_PORT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_PORT` constant)
  * `POP3->POP3_TIMEOUT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` constant)
* NTLM authentication has been removed - it never worked anyway!
  * `PHPMailer->Workstation`
  * `PHPMailer->Realm`
* `SingleTo` functionality is deprecated; this belongs at a higher level - PHPMailer is not a mailing list system.
* `SMTP::authenticate` method signature changed
* `parseAddresses()` is now static
* `validateAddress()` is now called statically from `parseAddresses()`
* `idnSupported()` is now static and is called statically from `punyencodeAddress()`
* `PHPMailer->SingleToArray` is now protected
* `fixEOL()` method removed - it duplicates `PHPMailer::normalizeBreaks()`, so use that instead
* Don't try to use an auth mechanism if it's not supported by the server
* Reorder automatic AUTH mechanism selector to try most secure method first
* `Extras` classes have been removed - use alternative packages from [packagist.org](https://packagist.org) instead
* Better handling of automatic transfer encoding switch in the presence of long lines
* Simplification of address validation - now uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` pattern by default, retains advanced options
* `Debugoutput` can accept a PSR-3 logger instance
* To reduce code footprint, the examples folder is no longer included in composer deployments or github zip files
* Trap low-level errors in SMTP, reports via debug output
* More reliable folding of message headers
* Inject your own SMTP implementation via `setSMTPInstance()` instead of having to subclass and override `getSMTPInstance()`.
* Make obtaining SMTP transaction ID more reliable
* Better handling of unreliable PHP timeouts
* Made `SMTPDebug = 4` slightly less noisy

## Version 5.2.25 (August 28th 2017)
* Make obtaining SMTP transaction ID more reliable
* Add Bosnian translation
* This is the last official release in the legacy PHPMailer 5.2 series; there may be future security patches (which will be found in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable)), but no further non-security PRs or issues will be accepted. Migrate to PHPMailer 6.0.

## Version 5.2.24 (July 26th 2017)
* **SECURITY** Fix XSS vulnerability in one of the code examples, [CVE-2017-11503](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-11503). The `code_generator.phps` example did not filter user input prior to output. This file is distributed with a `.phps` extension, so it it not normally executable unless it is explicitly renamed, so it is safe by default. There was also an undisclosed potential XSS vulnerability in the default exception handler (unused by default). Patches for both issues kindly provided by Patrick Monnerat of the Fedora Project.
* Handle bare codes (an RFC contravention) in SMTP server responses
* Make message timestamps more dynamic - calculate the date separately for each message
* More thorough checks for reading attachments.
* Throw an exception when trying to send a message with an empty body caused by an internal error.
* Replaced all use of MD5 and SHA1 hash functions with SHA256.
* Now checks for invalid host strings when sending via SMTP.
* Include timestamps in HTML-format debug output
* Improve Turkish, Norwegian, Serbian, Brazilian Portuguese & simplified Chinese translations
* Correction of Serbian ISO language code from `sr` to `rs`
* Fix matching of multiple entries in `Host` to match IPv6 literals without breaking port selection (see #1094, caused by a3b4f6b)
* Better capture and reporting of SMTP connection errors

## Version 5.2.23 (March 15th 2017)
* Improve trapping of TLS errors during connection so that they don't cause warnings, and are reported better in debug output
* Amend test suite so it uses PHPUnit version 4.8, compatible with older versions of PHP, instead of the version supplied by Travis-CI
* This forces pinning of some dev packages to older releases, but should make travis builds more reliable
* Test suite now runs on HHVM, and thus so should PHPMailer in general
* Improve Czech translations
* Add links to CVE-2017-5223 resources

## Version 5.2.22 (January 5th 2017)
* **SECURITY** Fix [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223), local file disclosure vulnerability if content passed to `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input. Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity. The fix for this means that calls to `msgHTML()` without a `$basedir` will not import images with relative URLs, and relative URLs containing `..` will be ignored.
* Add simple contact form example
* Emoji in test content

## Version 5.2.21 (December 28th 2016)
* Fix missed number update in version file - no functional changes

## Version 5.2.20 (December 28th 2016)
* **SECURITY** Critical security update for CVE-2016-10045 please update now! Thanks to [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com) and Paul Buonopane (@Zenexer).
* Note that this change will break VERP addresses in Sender if you're using mail() - workaround: use SMTP to localhost instead.

## Version 5.2.19 (December 26th 2016)
* Minor cleanup

## Version 5.2.18 (December 24th 2016)
* **SECURITY** Critical security update for CVE-2016-10033 please update now! Thanks to [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com).

## Version 5.0.1 (April 05, 2009)
* Temporary fix for missing attachments

## Version 5.0.0 (April 02, 2009)
With the release of this version, we are initiating a new version numbering
system to differentiate from the PHP4 version of PHPMailer.
Most notable in this release is fully object oriented code.

### class.smtp.php:
* Refactored class.smtp.php to support new exception handling
* code size reduced from 29.2 Kb to 25.6 Kb
* Removed unnecessary functions from class.smtp.php:
  - public function Expand($name) {
  - public function Help($keyword="") {
  - public function Noop() {
  - public function Send($from) {
  - public function SendOrMail($from) {
  - public function Verify($name) {

###  class.phpmailer.php:
* Refactored class.phpmailer.php with new exception handling
* Changed processing functionality of Sendmail and Qmail so they cannot be
  inadvertently used
* removed getFile() function, just became a simple wrapper for
  file_get_contents()
* added check for PHP version (will gracefully exit if not at least PHP 5.0)
* enhanced code to check if an attachment source is the same as an embedded or
  inline graphic source to eliminate duplicate attachments

### New /test_script
We have written a test script you can use to test the script as part of your
installation. Once you press submit, the test script will send a multi-mime
email with either the message you type in or an HTML email with an inline
graphic. Two attachments are included in the email (one of the attachments
is also the inline graphic so you can see that only one copy of the graphic
is sent in the email). The test script will also display the functional
script that you can copy/paste to your editor to duplicate the functionality.

### New examples
All new examples in both basic and advanced modes. Advanced examples show
   Exception handling.

### PHPDocumentator (phpdocs) documentation for PHPMailer version 5.0.0
All new documentation

## Version 2.3 (November 06, 2008)
* added Arabic language (many thanks to Bahjat Al Mostafa)
* removed English language from language files and made it a default within
  class.phpmailer.php - if no language is found, it will default to use
  the english language translation
* fixed public/private declarations
* corrected line 1728, $basedir to $directory
* added $sign_cert_file to avoid improper duplicate use of $sign_key_file
* corrected $this->Hello on line 612 to $this->Helo
* changed default of $LE to "\r\n" to comply with RFC 2822. Can be set by the user
  if default is not acceptable
* removed trim() from return results in EncodeQP
* /test and three files it contained are removed from version 2.3
* fixed phpunit.php for compliance with PHP5
* changed $this->AltBody = $textMsg; to $this->AltBody = html_entity_decode($textMsg);
* We have removed the /phpdoc from the downloads. All documentation is now on
  the http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com website.

## Version 2.2.1 () July 19 2008
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (my apologies, error on my part)

## Version 2.2 () July 15 2008
* Fixed redirect issue (display of UTF-8 in thank you redirect)
* fixed error in getResponse function declaration (class.pop3.php)
* PHPMailer now PHP6 compliant
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (endless loop from missing = sign)

## Version 2.1 (Wed, June 04 2008)
NOTE: WE HAVE A NEW LANGUAGE VARIABLE FOR DIGITALLY SIGNED S/MIME EMAILS. IF YOU CAN HELP WITH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

* added S/MIME functionality (ability to digitally sign emails)
  BIG THANKS TO "sergiocambra" for posting this patch back in November 2007.
  The "Signed Emails" functionality adds the Sign method to pass the private key
  filename and the password to read it, and then email will be sent with
  content-type multipart/signed and with the digital signature attached.
* fully compatible with E_STRICT error level
  - Please note:
    In about half the test environments this development version was subjected
    to, an error was thrown for the date() functions used (line 1565 and 1569).
    This is NOT a PHPMailer error, it is the result of an incorrectly configured
    PHP5 installation. The fix is to modify your 'php.ini' file and include the
    date.timezone = Etc/UTC (or your own zone)
    directive, to your own server timezone
  - If you do get this error, and are unable to access your php.ini file:
    In your PHP script, add
