DESCRIPTION:

    What is Securimage?

    Securimage is a PHP class that is used to generate and validate CAPTCHA
    images.
    
    The classes uses an existing PHP session or creates its own if
    none is found to store the CAPTCHA code.  In addition, a database can be
    used instead of session storage.
    
    Variables within the class are used to control the style and display of
    the image.  The class uses TTF fonts and effects for strengthening the
    security of the image.
    
    It also creates audible codes which are played for visually impared users.

UPGRADE NOTICE:
    3.6.3 and below:
    Securimage 3.6.4 fixed a XSS vulnerability in example_form.ajax.php.  It is
    recommended to upgrade to the latest version or delete example_form.ajax.php
    from the securimage directory on your website.

    3.6.2 and above:
    If you are upgrading to 3.6.2 or greater AND are using database storage,
    the table structure has changed in 3.6.2 adding an audio_data column for
    storing audio files in the database in order to support HTTP range
    requests.  Delete your tables and have Securimage recreate them or see
    the function createDatabaseTables() in securimage.php for the new structure
    depending on which database backend you are using and alter the tables as
    needed.  If using SQLite, just overwrite your existing securimage.sq3 file
    with the one from this release.

    If you are not using database tables for storage, ignore this notice.
